# Initial cvBot hack site

## Basics

index.js loads resume.json and spits out a bot that answers questions about the person in resume.json. You pose a question, in natural language, and get an answer.

## Caveats

Voice recognition ONLY works on Chrome. It could be extended to work on Firefox, but there's no point - the voice recognition is only impressive on mobile, and _no one_ uses FF on mobile.
